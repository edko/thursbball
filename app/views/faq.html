				<span class="md-title">How is the ThursBball time structured?</span>
			</md-card-title-text>
		</md-card-title>
		<md-card-content>
			<p>
				We divide into 2 closely matched teams and play 2 games of 40 minutes.  There is a 2-3 minute break between halves and games.  If there are more than 5 players per team, we employ mandatory substitution every 5 minutes using our sub-rotation sheet.  Warm up is from 10:00-10:15pm, and the first game starts around 10:20pm.

				<span class="md-title">Why cap the number of players to 16 each night?</span>
			</md-card-title-text>
		</md-card-title>
		<md-card-content>
			<p>
				We cap at 16 players each night due to our limitation of 1 court and our 2 hour timeframe.  If there is enough people interested we may look into reserving another 2 hour time slot on a different night.

			</md-card-title-text>
		</md-card-title>
		<md-card-content>
			<p>
				When you add yourself to the waitlist, the app will automatically add players on the waitlist (based on priority) to that night's roster if someone on the roster drops out.  You can choose to receive a SMS/Text or email notification when that happens.  Go to My Profile > Account to set your preference.

				No.  At this time it's a closed group and by invite only.  But you are welcome to bring guests with you if there are spaces available.  Guests still need to pay for the gym fees.

			<p>
				The cost is $10/per night.  You can pay each time you come to the gym.  However, if you sign up for more than 8 out of 12 nights, please pay in full.  Please pay me by cash, check (payable to Edison Ko), or Paypal to edisonko@gmail.com.
