Webapp to manage Thursday basketball roster.  The webapp allows each player to check-in to the dates they will be playing.  There is a max of 16 players per night.  If roster for the night is full, subsequent players are added to the waitlist so that when a player in the roster drops out (is removed), the app automatically adds the waitlist player to the roster.  A SMS/Text notification is sent to the waitlist player who was added.

Webapp built with AngularJS, Firebase, Angular Material, and Gulp.
