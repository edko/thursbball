# thursbball

Webapp to manage Thursday basketball roster.  The webapp allows each player to check-in to the dates they will be playing.  There is a max of 16 players per night.  If more than 16, then the app allows the next player to be on waitlist.  When there is space in the roster, the player on waitlist is added automatically to the roster for that night.

Webapp built with AngularJS, Firebase, and Angular Material.
